About the Author
I am a designer, and since you’ve clicked on this page, you must have already seen my portfolio.

An INFJ homebody who enjoys reading, writing, fishkeeping, painting, and all kinds of electronic gadgets.

Currently, my work revolves around two main areas:

The commercial operations of my own company
Personal projects
The commercial side is purely about making a living—getting paid to get things done. Most of the work (about 80-90%) never makes it into my portfolio because, although it’s my creation, it involves collaboration with clients and colleagues. I don’t consider it my design. It’s not a work of art; it’s a product. The remaining 10-20% that does end up in my portfolio consists of projects I feel are relatively well-executed and worth the extra effort. These are usually projects that align with my interests, resonate with the client’s aesthetic, or challenge my skills in some way.

I might sound a bit arrogant saying this, but since around 2019, I’ve rarely worried about not having clients. This sense of security led to a period of complacency, where I often procrastinated. Another reason, I think, is that commercial design is essentially the art of negotiation—and negotiation is, at its core, the art of compromise. I still have a long way to go in mastering this art.

Fortunately, this period of scattered downtime wasn’t entirely wasted.

Working with computers all day, I’ve naturally developed a deep fascination with them. I often feel grateful to live in an era where computers exist. This curiosity led me to explore all sorts of computer-related hobbies that I found interesting.

It’s like skating barefoot on an endless, dark icy lake—no skates needed. From setting up private servers and DIY NAS systems to building my first truly personal website, I gradually discovered the elegance and efficiency of controlling a computer solely through keyboard commands and shortcuts (as a designer who relies heavily on mice and drawing tablets, this felt oddly liberating). The process was indescribably satisfying. This brings me to the second point: personal projects.

About This Site
This site is one of my personal projects, a long-held idea to create a container of my own on the internet.

The content within this container is my publicly shared inner world.

The primary medium for creating this inner world is CG art. The entire creative process is also a mental experiment, hence the name: CG Art Lab.

Tools Are Extensions of Human Limbs
I once heard the saying, “Tools are extensions of human limbs.” For example, a fan is an extension of the hand, a wheel is an extension of the legs, and a telephone is an extension of the mouth and ears. By that logic, a computer is an extension of the brain. I once wrote an article titled How to Build a Second Brain, where I briefly discussed my perspective on digital note-taking as a tool. Broadly speaking, whether it’s design, writing, or coding, it all comes down to how we use computers to create better, understand them more deeply, and refine them to make them more obedient and efficient.

Computers are designed by some of the smartest people on the planet. For most ordinary folks like me, it’s hard to make computers truly adapt to us—often, we don’t even know where to start. My underlying philosophy here is: identify the right problems, improve your skills, and grow worthy of the tools you want to use.

Finding *a* problem is easy; finding the right problem is harder. Once you’ve put in the effort to identify it, documenting both the problem and the process of solving it is inherently valuable.

Writing Is Thinking Itself
In the past, I never bothered to document the solutions to the problems I encountered—whether it was searching for a keyboard shortcut or building a Hackintosh. I thought it was too much trouble, and I assumed these methods would become obsolete quickly as technology evolved. Now, I realize how wrong I was.

These techniques and methods may be mere “tactics,” but dismissing them outright goes against the “principle.”

I’ve decided to diligently record these processes. After all, they are my own creations, skills, experiences, and reflections. The journey is mine alone, and publishing them publicly is a way to hold myself accountable—to ensure the content meets my own standards first.

Then, it’s up to you to decide if you like it.
