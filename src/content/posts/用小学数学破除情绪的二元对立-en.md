When people talk about emotions online, they often jump straight to emotional management. I'm not in a hurry to discuss management - if we haven't even understood what emotions are, what is there to manage?

When I paint, I definitely have emotions and feelings. Each stroke carries emotional sensations until the painting is complete. If you look at my paintings, you might guess that the artist was probably in a bad mood while painting, or at least not a good one. Why would you make this judgment? Because the artwork gives you negative feelings, and you conclude that the artist's emotions were also negative. But even if the artist's emotions were terrible, you wouldn't necessarily feel bad emotions when viewing their work - unless they painted you in an unflattering way.

It took me a long time of painting and experiencing many things to realize that emotions and feelings are different and should not be confused. Feelings can be physical or psychological. People often describe "good emotions" using "good feelings" - such as happiness, pleasure, excitement, comfort... In short, no more than two types: physical comfort and psychological comfort.

If we don't use these good feelings to describe emotions, how should we define "good emotions"?

Many people don't understand how we can separate feelings from emotions. This is because if we confuse the two, people tend to assume that feelings are the driving force behind actions, while emotions are just side effects. For example, if someone insults me and I retaliate with a punch. Their insult creates unpleasant feelings in me, and these unpleasant feelings become the motivation for my retaliation. The underlying implication is that I'm not actively choosing to hit them - they made me feel bad, I'm passive, I have no choice but to retaliate.

But there are too many counterexamples in reality. Many people get insulted without retaliating, some even smile it off. Do they not have feelings? This shows that feelings are not the driving force behind behavior. Feelings are just a state of experience - being affected by others' actions puts me in an unpleasant state, and then anger arises. It's the emotion of anger that becomes the motivation for that punch.

If we confuse feelings with emotions, we can't understand what happens between experiencing something and taking action. This leads people to focus only on changing their feelings without being able to control their behavior. In reality, factors affecting feelings include not just behavior, but also the environment, sensory stimuli, and physiological state. Focusing only on feelings while ignoring emotions and behavior is like trying to stop boiling water by skimming the surface.

Therefore, we need to set aside feelings to understand what emotions truly are.

Negative emotions are easier to understand, with anger being the most common. Anger often makes people unaware of what they're doing, but even then, if you measure their blood pressure, it's definitely higher than usual. "Higher" means there's a change compared to when they're not angry. Thus, negative emotions are a force that drives change and triggers behavior.

The question is: if we set aside feelings, what are positive emotions? Setting feelings aside, negative emotions can raise blood pressure, cause illness, even death, but positive emotions only maintain normal blood pressure - they don't make it "more normal." A happy person can become happier, but never "more normal."

This is the difficult part to understand: positive emotions are not the driving force for change; positive emotions are a capacity that represents how much negative emotion a person can bear. For example, if a rope breaks under 100 pounds but a chain holds it fine, we say the chain is better than the rope.

Two employees get called into the boss's office and receive the same insult from the same person. One retaliates, the other remains silent. Same situation, same feelings, different people produce different emotions - this is an undeniable fact. I mention this to better define what positive emotions are.

Now, let's continue our analysis using elementary school math knowledge.

If we set -9 to -1 to represent levels of negative emotions, with -9 being the worst and 0 representing calmness. -1 to 0 represents relatively mild negative emotions, which we can call negative moods.

You'll find that some people's negative emotions never reach -9, at most reaching -5. We can say that -5 is this person's negative emotion tolerance limit, and the distance from -5 to -9 represents their positive emotion level, which is 4.

In other words, a person with a positive emotion level of 4, even if the world ends, their emotions will only reach -5 at worst.

Two important points to note here: First, this person's negative emotion level changes with feelings, but their positive emotion level remains 4. This is like having a lung capacity of 5000ml but not breathing 5000ml every time. That is, positive emotions are actually a capacity - the ability to bear negative emotions.

Second, this capacity to bear negative emotions can also change. Like lung capacity, it doesn't change in the short term, but that doesn't mean it never changes - there are methods to learn and practice.

Now let's look at extreme cases. If a person has a positive emotion level of 0, that means their negative emotions can reach -9 at worst, potentially leading to destructive behavior. But this doesn't mean they'll necessarily encounter situations that push them to -9 in their lifetime. Most of the time, they're between -1 and 0, generally experiencing negative moods, and might even reach 0 when good things happen. 0 can't be considered a negative emotion anymore - when negative emotions are at 0, what arises is calmness, a neutral emotion. But don't think that after reaching 0, negative emotions turn positive. Positive emotions don't directly come from negative emotions; positive emotions only function when negative emotions arise. A spring only shows its elasticity when compressed - this elasticity is like positive emotions.

Another common misconception is thinking positive emotions are a driving force that pushes you to act. For example, when I'm diligently painting, I seem full of motivation and quite happy while painting. Actually, this is just negative emotions appearing alongside good feelings - I'm venting and releasing negative emotions, which feels good. When a warrior prepares to kill their enemy, filled with rage, they naturally feel heroic and righteous, with no sympathy or compassion for their fellow human. If their anger level were 0, they probably couldn't do it, let alone with added sympathy and compassion.

Even if a person can reach -9 in negative emotions with 0 capacity, they must have experienced the state of 0 negative emotions - like at birth. This is like a car that can run even with 0 passenger capacity. This innate stress resistance is something everyone is born with. Actually, like lung capacity, acquired stress resistance is developed from this innate capacity.

Can innate stress resistance change? Yes. It can be developed into acquired stress resistance, or it can be destroyed. When is it destroyed? When a person deeply accepts certain wrong beliefs. What kind of wrong beliefs have such power? From what I know, it's when life experience and environment never teach them, and they themselves don't realize, that making mistakes - or worse, doing wrong - doesn't lead to suffering. This feedback loop gets completely severed. Just knowing that "making mistakes leads to suffering" isn't enough - that's not true knowing. True knowing is understanding that touching fire hurts your hand, so you never touch it again.

This kind of belief can destroy innate stress resistance. When this capacity reaches 0, although they might have moments without negative emotions, they can only experience neutral calmness, never positive emotions. That means they'll never enhance their stress resistance until they start questioning their ingrained experiences and beliefs.

Finally, I'll leave you with a question: Do emotions and feelings really have good and bad distinctions?
