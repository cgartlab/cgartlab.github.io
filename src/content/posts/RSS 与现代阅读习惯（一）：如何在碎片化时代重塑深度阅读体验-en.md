## Preface: The Accelerating Era, Where Do We Go From Here?

Let me start with a term that reveals my age: "surfing the internet." If you remember this term like I do, you're probably at least a 90s kid.

The term "surfing the internet" indeed carries the memories of a generation. It was a vivid description of internet behavior during the early days of the internet. This term was popular from the late 1990s to the early 2000s, when the internet was just beginning to become widespread in China. For many people, going online was a novel and exploratory experience.

My first "surfing" experience was in an internet cafe. Interestingly, my dad took me there, and even more interestingly, he was an elementary school Chinese teacher. I asked him why he took me to the internet cafe? What was he thinking at the time? His reasoning was that he wanted me to experience something new. When we got there, I didn't understand anything - I didn't even know how to use a mouse. My understanding of computers was that they were advanced little televisions. I watched him operate it, and the words on the screen could be clicked. Wow, magic - I didn't understand it but was deeply impressed.

Besides being impressed, I clearly remember that webpages back then were very pure, like newspapers. Even stamp-sized images loaded at a speed comparable to printing. Many years later, I learned through a video on Tudou.com that those underlined, clickable texts were called "hyperlinks," the thing used to view websites was called an "IE browser," and the thing running the browser was called "Windows 98."

The scary part is that this video was less than 5 minutes long, yet I gained so much information from it.

The even scarier part is that now I can just take out my phone and casually ask an AI, and it will tell me everything about "surfing the internet," and then thoughtfully ask: "Do you have any other questions?"

I can ask anything I want, but several times I've felt trapped by something.

When the internet accelerates text to the speed of light, content inevitably grows exponentially, not to mention technology. Compared to their speed, humanity itself seems to be standing still.

## Slow is Fast

A few years ago, I remember reading an interview with Jiang Wen. I forgot his exact words, but the general idea was:

> "I think people still need to read more words to keep their minds active enough, because you have to put in some effort to understand what others mean."

Later, reading Xu Wenbing's "Know Yourself," I also forgot the exact text, but the general idea was:

> "When you're eating, the food is also eating you. When you're healthy, you like to eat steamed buns; when you're sick, you have to drink porridge. When you have strength, you also hope your opponent has some strength."

I don't remember the exact words of either of these quotes - they were certainly longer than what I've written here. Yet I remember the information they conveyed. I think this is mainly because their medium itself is text. Just like how the most widely spread parts of a movie are always the classic lines, I found them quite resonant at the time, never thinking I'd use them in this article. I'm placing them here to constantly remind myself before discussing RSS and deep reading: their medium is, first and foremost, text.

Text is the foundation of human civilization's progress. It carries the recording and transmission of information, the accumulation and dissemination of knowledge, the development and deepening of thought, the management and organization of society, the collision and exchange of cultures, the popularization and enhancement of education, and personal self-expression.

When we turn the pages of a book, immersed in the plot of a story, or exploring new perspectives in an article, our minds are nourished and our horizons expanded. This experience is priceless - it gives us the opportunity to temporarily escape the noise of daily life and enter a space of thinking and imagination that belongs only to ourselves. Figuring out how to escape information bombardment and algorithm recommendations is, to some extent, more like a helpless compromise in the face of the current internet environment.

Technological progress means that chip speeds are essentially the speed of light. The only thing in humans that approaches the speed of light is our nerve signal-driven thinking. The difference is, when we slow down a bit, we actually become faster.
