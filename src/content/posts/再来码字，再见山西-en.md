Long time no see, I've started writing again.

Writing sounds more elegant when you call it "writing"—as soon as you change the term, it feels like the thing you're about to talk about is different, as if all the actions surrounding writing become sacred. But actually, compared to writing, I was more willing to draw at first. The main reason was that I told myself: a picture is worth a thousand words—if you can express something clearly with one drawing, why write a bunch of words?

Oh my, how naive. I completely failed to understand the power behind words. Next, I used my drawing skills to get into university and continued learning to draw with computers. I discovered that a large image takes up tens or hundreds of megabytes of data space, while the complete Harry Potter series in plain text e-book format only takes a few megabytes. This only strengthened my belief.

I don't think drawing is inherently superior to writing. It was simply that I felt more skilled at drawing and wasn't good at speaking, so I avoided things I wasn't good at.

Then, as I kept drawing, I started feeling something was off. Because every time I posted any drawing, I was asked to write an "artist statement". When I went abroad for graduate studies, I actually had to produce a several-hundred-page thesis for just a few paintings to prove I was qualified to receive the degree. I began to realize the seriousness of the problem—beyond images, people also needed to see me organize the thoughts behind what was output on the canvas using text.

Before going abroad for studies, I was working at a TV station and opened a WeChat public account in my spare time to write something. But at that time, my reasons for writing were mainly two-fold: first, public accounts were everywhere, so there was a bandwagon effect; second, there was deep-seated resistance to traditional media work from my soul. So the motivation that drove me to write didn't come from within myself. After resigning to study abroad, I naturally had no reason to continue writing. The public account was abandoned. When I look through the backups on my computer now, my eyes hurt too much to bear reading them.

After returning from studying abroad, my freely disposable time was still divided into fragments by various work tasks. These fragments of time, when placed in this era of information explosion, are like water droplets on a hot pan.

From my own experience, compared to video content, text content consumes more of my energy and time. With videos, you can at least fast-forward, change playback speed, and decide whether to continue watching a video in under a minute. But with text, if you misread one word, the meaning you grasp could be completely different. So how to handle these text-based information sources that gave me headaches gradually became the top priority. Initially, my strategy was:

First step: limit input. The principle was to reduce the apps I used for consuming content to three or fewer. For example, I unfollowed all public accounts in WeChat and moved professional and work-related accounts to WeChat Reading. WeChat became just a chat app—pure social interaction.

Second step: consolidate other content I was interested in. The solution I found was RSS. I aggregated all content I was interested in through RSS subscriptions. As for those authors who posted quality content on specific platforms—let them be. As a side note, I estimate few post-00s have heard of RSS. This is something from the ancient internet era—a way to subscribe to and push information, essentially the predecessor of "remember to follow, family". Quite interesting. When I first started using computers, I knew nothing about these. I definitely need to write something about how to handle information overload.

Third step: After all this, the apps I used for consuming textual content were reduced to WeChat, RSS subscriptions, and Kindle. Another side note: recently, I'm not very optimistic about Kindle's development potential in China—it might just not be suitable for local conditions.

After implementing this series of operations, I was exposed to more high-quality text content and naturally had more time for thinking. I no longer had the energy to refresh those algorithmic recommendations that change every second. It's quite magical—even though both are subscriptions, public accounts didn't give me this sense of stability. Perhaps it's due to differences in product form. So when I purely followed my interests and saw interesting content, I naturally generated many ideas that could make my eyes light up. Over time (about a year), these ideas also took root in my mind and developed wonderful connections with each other. From what I understand, the inspirations and creativity that lead the world are also generated through such methods. Since that's the case, I should record them—just in case, right?

So now, as you can see, I've obediently rolled back to writing again.
