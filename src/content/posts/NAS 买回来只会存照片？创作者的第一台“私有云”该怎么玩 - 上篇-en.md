## Preface

This series skips complex technologies and focuses on establishing the most basic storage and workflow logic for creators. For better reading experience, it's divided into two parts. This part is for beginners, if you already have a NAS, you can check out the next part.

![Last year, I was debugging the NAS in my study room from the sofa](_images/解析设计师的第二大脑：从理念到实践-1754577343145%201.webp)

More and more people are using NAS these days. However, many people first hear about NAS through advertisements that emphasize storing large amounts of movies, files, photos, and videos - essentially a networked "hard drive box."

I happened to be the opposite. My first contact accelerated my efficiency by N times. Only later did I realize, oh, it's also a hard drive box.

![It's been quite a while](_images/NAS-买回来只会存照片？创作者的第一台“私有云”该怎么玩-1769182523451.webp)

I first learned about NAS in 2014 when I was still working at a TV station. At that time, I didn't even know what brand or model it was (probably Synology in those days). The director sent account credentials in a QQ group, and we could log in by entering the address in our browsers. I naively thought he had bought a website… Looking back now, that's both right and wrong.

After the office got a NAS, colleagues responsible for shooting only needed to copy materials into it, and anyone with an account could access them simultaneously. During editing, we could directly convert to proxies without everyone needing to copy their own files. I was curious - how come the TV station's massive amount of materials hadn't filled it up in a year?

When I asked colleagues, I learned they had bought 32T total. Now (2026), the NAS I'm using (see below) only has 16T.

Oh, so it's still just a hard drive box.

## What is NAS Really?

Physically, NAS is essentially still a computer, fundamentally no different from the desktops and laptops we use daily.

If you just need a hard drive box to store large amounts of files and worry about file loss, I'd recommend getting a cloud storage subscription instead. After all, big companies offer more stable and reliable services, and many cloud storage services now include NAS-like features.

Here's a side note: I use NAS, but I also have an annual subscription to a certain cloud storage service, mainly for my parents to watch American shows and movies on their projector. It has a feature that scans video files and automatically generates a poster wall, supporting 4K original quality. When I encounter particularly good movies, I save them to my NAS. The biggest advantage is that it's easy to use with abundant online resources - my parents can easily find what they want to watch, and I can just save good movies there and tell them. In my view, **cloud storage subscriptions are more valuable than any major video platform's premium membership**, even Baidu Netdisk.

Okay, back to the main topic.

![The question of renting vs. buying](_images/07%20玄光周刊-双钻石设计模型：从用户需求到产品落地的黄金框架解析-1754596998369%201.webp)

If cloud storage is like renting an apartment, NAS can be understood as buying a private villa outright.

Apartments require rent, of course. The advantage is that if something gets "bumped or scratched" (like accidental deletion, temporary service instability), you don't feel too bad because the main responsibility lies with the platform. The downside is dealing with the landlord's moods, potential price increases, and most importantly, the landlord has keys and can enter anytime.

As for private villas, besides being expensive and requiring self-maintenance, **for me, the freedom and sense of control far outweigh these minor inconveniences**. Of course, the fact that it's expensive might be my own shortcoming.

For creators, I understand NAS as a "data center." It appears as a computer that hums all day long, but its essence is a collection of services, permissions, processes, and data that can operate 24/7.

Only by establishing this perspective can you potentially realize its future potential. Especially in the AI era, the value of personal data is increasingly recognized. The data surrounding each individual is unique, which means that only by understanding and mastering your own data can you, as technical barriers lower, have the ability to customize Agents that truly belong to you. This is my personal judgment, and I'm practicing it firsthand. I'll just touch on this here.

In short, the first step isn't to research RAID configurations, Synology, Feiniu, virtual machines, Docker, command lines, and other technical details. Instead, make a list to clarify your workflow, write it down, and see if adding this NAS can truly improve efficiency.

From my experience so far, the more your work involves your own data flow, the more significant the acceleration will become.

## What Do You Really Need NAS to Solve?

As a designer, clarifying needs is something I think about almost daily for my clients. Yes, many people seek help, even paying for it, without actually knowing their real needs.

They just want you to try things out for them.

Only then might they realize what they don't want.

This applies to wealthy clients, and even more so to ordinary workers like us. I mentioned this in [a previous article](https://cgartlab.com/posts/rss-2/), so let me quote a passage here:

> In fact, the prevalence of recommendation algorithms today can also prove from the side that most people don't really understand their own needs, or to put it more bluntly, are too lazy to understand.

So how do you clarify your real needs for this NAS data center?

Actually, it's quite simple - just ask yourself in a different way. For example:

- I'm a photographer or graphic designer - can NAS serve as my material library, allowing me to access inspiration anytime?
- I'm a writer - can NAS serve as an e-book library, storing extensive literature that I can read on my phone while traveling abroad, even sitting on a hotel toilet?
- I'm a teacher - can NAS host a website to record my teaching experiences or create interactive case studies? Don't think teachers aren't creators - it depends on whether they know how to teach.
- I'm a programmer - well, the possibilities are endless.

Essentially, it's about asking more specific and detailed questions. Many things often come down to this small difference - some choose to advance rapidly against the current, while others choose to drift with the flow silently.

If you've clarified your needs, then feel free to research brands and models.

Alright, in the next part, I'll share in detail the four-layer storage logic for creators that I'm currently using.
