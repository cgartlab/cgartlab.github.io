## About the Work

Meditation is a form of consciousness transformation  
It is a process of dissecting one's inner self  
It is a path to approaching reality infinitely  

I first encountered this concept in 2013  
In the subsequent years of work and life  
It gradually became a habit of communicating with myself  

This wonderful experience is perfectly suited for expression through digital painting  
Over the following years  
I created this series in my spare time  
Each piece speaks to a different stage I experienced  
At each stage, I chose different themes to converse with my inner self  

From the visual perspective  
The underlying human psyche is far from beautiful  
But it's not entirely unbearable either  
Heavy oppression, contradictory conflicts, complex struggles  
All represent the authentic self
