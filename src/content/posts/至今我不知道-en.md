Every time I create something in a different style, I have to search for many references based on others' requirements or my own concepts.

Most of these references are images - some modern, some ancient. The only commonality is that they originate from very primitive concepts, representing a small group of people's interpretation of the world and themselves in a specific era.

Today is already an era dominated by images (videos are essentially moving images), while concepts, especially fragmented ones, obscure people's thinking. Reading fragments on screens makes it so easy to correlate them with one's own life. Perhaps the convenience of information access channels has made people's viewing behavior extremely casual.

Knowing more doesn't necessarily mean that the decisions, actions, and resulting outcomes will have greater penetration.

When we understand a work's content today, we first assign it a drawer in advance. This drawer is labeled with rich tags indicating who created it, when it was made, where it was produced, and what methods were used. These are called knowledge backgrounds.

Only under the premise of having at least some knowledge background will people continue to understand the content from the sensory level. If we approach it directly through sensation, people usually don't trust their own feelings.

For example, you might start loving music you previously had no interest in because of a movie or game.

When receiving information, knowledge background is certainly necessary, but ultimately we return to the pure sensory level. The difficult part is how to switch freely between these two states.

Take listening to music as an example. Music itself has genres, styles, eras, composers... these are all knowledge backgrounds. When you feel moved by a musical melody or lyrics, you naturally follow these knowledge background labels to find similar music. Recommendation algorithms also use this as reference to guess what you might want to listen to next.

However, besides lyrics and melody (I actually believe melody encompasses lyrics - when I was young and didn't understand English, it didn't stop me from liking Linkin Park), I think there's another element that moves people - the texture of the instrument's sound itself. This is the pure sensory level. I believe great works ultimately restore people to this pure sensory level, so pure that you cannot describe it, at most sharing it with friends to let them experience it too. In pure sensation, you completely forget everything you previously knew. Because this feeling is so new - new enough to break through your cognition, new enough that you don't understand it but are deeply moved.

It's hard to say whether this feeling is brought by the work itself or generated by yourself. What's certain is that they simultaneously emerge, transform, and vanish in this spacetime. I'm convinced that if the feeling brought by the work is one, and the part generated by myself is also one, then at that moment, one plus one must be greater than two.

What exactly is that extra part? I still don't know.
