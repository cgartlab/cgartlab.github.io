This week's cover was shot at Qingdao Oriental Movie Metropolis—one night in May when I was working overtime until late and encountered sudden heavy fog on my way back to the hotel, creating a very cyberpunk atmosphere.

## Unexpected Turn of Events

Due to various coincidences, I joined a domestic film crew working on a theatrical movie production at the end of March this year. Because of this, the weekly has essentially turned into a quarterly publication. Recently, work pace has slowed down a bit, so I'm rushing to update this issue.

Throughout my career, this is the first time I've participated in such a large-scale project, and the pressure has been immense. Specific work content involves confidentiality and can't be discussed here. In short, this is the most complex and exhausting project I've ever worked on. Fortunately, the team consists of top experts from various fields—I learn something new almost every day, then encounter unprecedented problems. Being able to witness the industry's boundaries gradually advancing alongside such talented individuals is truly an honor.

Looking beyond the technical aspects, this kind of large-scale collaboration across different professions, industries, ages, and cognitive levels really tests the flexibility of personal workflows. I'll gradually share more after the confidentiality period ends.

## NotebookLM - Google's AI Note-Taking Application

While writing [[RSS and Modern Reading Habits (Part 2): Regaining Control of Information Collection]], I tried using it to research and organize materials about RSS and information overload. The results somewhat exceeded expectations—it could actually generate a 10-minute podcast based on provided materials (files, links, images you upload), featuring dialogue between male and female virtual characters, with surprisingly high completion quality, and in Chinese. Other highlights include generating note documents and mind maps based on specific topics.

## NoteGen - AI Note-Taking Application Focused on Recording and Writing

Another open-source AI note-taking application on GitHub (5k+ stars) focused on recording and writing direction. It's a free note tool emphasizing lightweight and clean experience, designed for users pursuing efficient and simple recording. Its installation package is only about ten megabytes, requiring no complex configuration for quick installation and use.

The software is completely free with all features open, avoiding subscription fees or ad integration, while promising no bundled software, ensuring clean and interference-free user experience. From a product positioning perspective, Notegen focuses on "zero burden" as its core, providing basic note services suitable for users needing quick recording but not wanting to be disturbed by redundant features.

## Silicon Flow - Large Model Service Provider

A domestic large model service provider that recently launched a new version of its platform. What's particularly interesting is that they've opened their API for free testing, allowing users to experience various large model capabilities directly. For developers and tech enthusiasts, this provides a good opportunity to understand and test the current state of domestic large model technology.

## Mode Brand Redesign - Double Diamond Framework Analysis

Mode recently underwent a comprehensive brand redesign, adopting the double diamond framework that's been widely discussed in the design industry. This framework emphasizes the importance of both divergent thinking (exploring possibilities) and convergent thinking (making decisions) in the design process.

What's particularly noteworthy is their emphasis on "warm technology"—the idea that technology should serve human needs and emotions rather than being cold and impersonal. This aligns well with current trends where user experience and emotional connection are becoming increasingly important in product design.

## Creative Workflow Insights

Participating in large-scale film production has given me new perspectives on creative workflows:

- **Collaboration is key** - Different expertise must work seamlessly together
- **Flexibility matters** - Being able to adapt to changing requirements
- **Documentation saves time** - Clear records prevent misunderstandings
- **Technology enhances creativity** - The right tools can significantly improve workflow efficiency
