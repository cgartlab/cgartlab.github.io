Hello everyone,

Writing this weekly wasn't a long-planned endeavor—it was more of a spontaneous idea that struck me two weeks ago.

Back in 2015, driven by curiosity and boredom, I started my first WeChat public account while still working full-time at a TV station. Over two years, I wrote about a dozen articles sporadically but never stuck with it. Looking back now, I believe if I had persisted, it would have profoundly transformed my perspective.

When my interest in writing resurfaced, my increased life experience and subtle shifts in values made me increasingly averse to the noise and chaos of the Chinese internet. Meanwhile, the rise of AI has accelerated its decline—this is just the nature of the times and human behavior, nothing to be done about it.

Of course, I hope more people see the content I create, but when it comes to writing, I'm not one to follow trends blindly, jumping on whatever's hot. I believe chasing traffic too aggressively often comes with hidden costs paid in installments. So in 2021, I officially decided to build my own small platform.

Setting aside all the technical hurdles I encountered, half a year has passed. To my surprise, I found that programming and writing have brought me almost entirely positive feedback, with the lowest interaction metrics being single digits.

To date, my personal blog has published over 120,000 words publicly, with total readership approaching 350,000, and I've even earned four-figure cash income.

Gradually, I realized a problem: the topics I want to write about aren't niche-specific, and the fields I'm eager to share are becoming increasingly diverse. While I enjoy writing freely, this isn't ideal for reader experience. Additionally, having to work on commercial projects makes update frequency quite unstable—many articles over 5,000 words get delayed, causing at least a week's hiatus.

So I started looking for content formats that might solve these issues:

- First, keep it concise—under 2,000 words to speed up your reading time
- Maintain relatively fixed content formats to streamline creation
- Cover the fields mentioned on the homepage, but don't prioritize based on reader interest
- Source material primarily from my personal digital notes database

I think this approach should make weekly updates quite manageable. Honestly, there's also a personal motive—I want to see how long I can keep this weekly going. As for writing quality, it's consistent with blog articles—all viewpoints are for reference only and do not constitute any investment or purchasing advice.

By the way, all weekly content will only be updated on this site and via email subscription for now.

See you next week—let's progress together.
