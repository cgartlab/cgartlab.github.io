This week's cover was shot on a small island near Qingdao Golden Beach. The inner side of the circular island path is lined with these pine trees blown sideways by sea winds, combined with dense pine needles creating unique textures resembling waves and rolling clouds.

## Built My Own RSS Service

I replaced Folo with TinyTinyRSS as my main reader. The image above shows how it looks viewing this public account's official website article pushes in a desktop browser. After about a week of use, I'm very satisfied with both speed and stability. I'll gradually add extension features based on other needs.

Folo + RSSHub's combined scalability is already quite rich, almost the ceiling in the RSS field. However, Folo recently launched an Android client. Perhaps for initial marketing promotion, clicking the update popup on the mobile web version automatically redirects to Google Store without any option to return to the web version, even after clearing cache and refreshing. But after downloading and installing, I couldn't log in using either GitHub or Google accounts. Google Play Store shows many others encountered the same issue.

Being unable to log into the app, plus the web version being unusable, made me realize again that any third-party service is uncontrollable. Whether in UI design, product philosophy, lifecycle, or personal data, you can't achieve maximum freedom and security.

Only you can rely on yourself.

## Invisible Details in Interaction Design

> Interaction design is an art form that creates smooth experiences responding to human intentions.

The author carefully selected and meticulously organized parts of iOS and macOS interaction interfaces, attempting to analyze various design thoughts behind human-computer interaction design. He believes such reflection can greatly help designers develop more design intuition. Friends engaged in UI design should definitely check it out—the article embeds many high-quality real-shot videos helping understand principles.

Currently, my work also relates to human-computer interaction, but applied to human-computer interaction in sci-fi movies (FUI). Compared to real-world UI, the biggest difference in film UI design is needing to simultaneously satisfy world-building settings and actor performances. It requires more consideration of interaction rationality and artistic visual consistency—technical implementation is relatively easier. After the project's confidentiality period ends, I can start a separate series to properly share this.

## Migrating Playlists to Apple Music

![SongShift Playlist Migration Tool](../_images/08%20玄光周刊-金沙滩的松树-1754597354573.webp)

Recently needed to migrate music playlists from another platform to Apple Music. After trying several tools, found SongShift works quite well. It supports migration between multiple music platforms, with relatively high matching accuracy. The free version has some limitations, but for occasional use it's sufficient.

What I appreciate is its batch processing capability—you don't need to migrate songs one by one. Just authorize both platforms, select playlists, and it automatically matches and transfers. Of course, some niche songs might not match perfectly, requiring manual checking.

## Personal Workflow Insights

Building my own RSS service taught me several valuable lessons:

- **Control matters**: Self-hosting gives you full control over data and features
- **Simplicity beats complexity**: Sometimes the simplest solutions work best
- **Backup plans are essential**: Always have alternatives ready
- **Document everything**: Keep records of configurations and processes

What tools or services have you found indispensable in your creative workflow? Have you ever considered self-hosting any of them?
