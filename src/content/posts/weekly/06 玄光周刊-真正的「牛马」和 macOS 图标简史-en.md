title: 06 Xuan Guang Weekly - The Real "Workhorses" and macOS Icon History
published: 2025-07-18
description: From the self-deprecating "workhorse" label of modern workers to the carefree existence of real workhorses, this article explores the impermanent nature of technology and design from a Zen perspective. Tracing macOS icon style evolution over nearly 30 years (skeuomorphism → flat design → liquid glass), it reveals Apple's design language shift from function-driven to emotional expression. Combining WWDC 2025 liquid glass design and AR layout speculation, it proposes balancing technological innovation with Zen living: embracing the present like workhorses while maintaining openness to the future in the digital wave.

This week's cover was shot at Qingdao Oriental Movie Metropolis on my way to work.

Across the river, vegetable fields stretch lush and green, with cicada songs wantonly permeating the air. A magpie perches on the highest branch, tilting its head to observe two "guards" on the ground. They seem to be discussing something, or perhaps thinking nothing at all, simply enjoying this rare moment of leisure.

Modern workers often self-deprecatingly call themselves "workhorses," while real workhorses never have such worries. They labor all day without contemplating why they live. When their owners are absent, they become temporary masters of this land.

Humans always think they're superior to animals, forgetting we're equally driven by survival pressures. But real workhorses don't care about these things—they live in the present, eating when hungry, sleeping when tired. Humans, however, are always busy thinking about meaning, planning the future, reminiscing about the past.

An interesting "Cyber Wooden Fish" website. The author trained a large language model based on Buddhist, Taoist, and Confucian classics, allowing direct dialogue with these sages.

## macOS Icon History — Basic Apple Guy

> In macOS 26, Apple announced a completely new look for its user interface: liquid glass. Physical icon elements give way to softer, shinier, more transparent icons. Rounded rectangles become more rounded, and Apple removed the ability for icon elements to extend beyond the icon rectangle (as seen in current icons like GarageBand, Photo Booth, Dictionary, etc.). — Basic Apple Guy

At this year's WWDC, Apple released the new "liquid glass" visual design system. I've been wanting to share my thoughts about it. Looking at this design system alone, the immediate impression might indeed seem somewhat flashy, reminiscent of the Windows 7 & Vista era.

Coincidentally, today I came across an author who compiled the most representative icons from Mac systems over the past 30 years on his blog. When placing icons of different styles together, you can clearly see the trade-offs designers made regarding what information they wanted to convey. Now, the once clear boundary between "skeuomorphism" and "flat design" is becoming increasingly blurred.

On the other hand, this massive design style change is global. Combining these two points, I strongly agree with [this article's](https://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2025/06/weekly-issue-353.html) proposal that "Apple is laying out AR," still betting that the next computing platform will be augmented reality.

## Design Philosophy Reflections

Observing these design transitions reminds me that technology and design trends are constantly changing, much like the seasons. What seems cutting-edge today might appear dated tomorrow. The real challenge isn't keeping up with every trend, but understanding the underlying principles that make good design timeless.

Real workhorses don't worry about whether they're using the latest tools—they focus on doing their work well with what they have. Perhaps there's wisdom in adopting a similar approach to our creative tools and workflows.

What design trends have you observed recently? How do you balance staying current with maintaining a stable, productive workflow?
