This week's cover comes from my supervisor—it doesn't love work but enjoys watching me work. Staring at the mouse cursor moving back and forth, it can persist here for 3 hours. It doesn't like hard wooden desktops, so I sacrificed my laptop sleeve. If replaced with a softer mat, it would probably persist even longer.

## The "Left Foot Stepping on Right Foot" Creative Method

Have you ever had this experience: organizing notes to write an article, but during the note organization process, new article ideas emerge? Like "left foot stepping on right foot" in martial arts novels—seemingly impossible but able to gain leverage in mid-air, achieving new ascension. Recently, while improving my knowledge base and writing, I frequently experienced this "self-propelling" cycle.

This might sound mystical, but the core lies in deeply coupling the two processes of **creative output** and **knowledge management**. It's not creating from nothing but actively applying and feeding back into your existing system—like the "thought specimen" library I mentioned in [Fragment Writing - Building a Thought Specimen](link), and the "style landscapes (Stylescapes)" discussed in [07 Xuan Guang Weekly - Double Diamond Design Model: Golden Framework Analysis from User Needs to Product Implementation](link).

Specifically, this cycle contains two interlocking "feet":

1. **Right Foot (Knowledge Management as Creation)**: Stop viewing note-taking as mere collection. Whenever reading, observing, or thinking, force yourself to record with "writing intention." Not copying but annotating, connecting, raising questions, forming individual "content embryos" with independent viewpoints. This is like building the "questioning framework" mentioned in [When AI Starts "Learning": How Should We Ask ChatGPT Questions?](obsidian://open?file=%E5%BD%93AI%E5%BC%80%E5%A7%8B%E2%80%9C%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0%E2%80%9D%EF%BC%9A%E6%88%91%E4%BB%AC%E8%AF%A5%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E5%90%91ChatGPT%E6%8F%90%E9%97%AE%EF%BC%9F.md), preparing structured ammunition for output.

2. **Left Foot (Creation as Knowledge Management)**: When needing formal writing (like this weekly), directly return to your note library for "treasure hunting." The writing process becomes a thematic "compilation," deep stitching, and logical sublimation of your fragmented notes. The completed article's core viewpoints and framework are then decomposed into new notes, re-sedimented into the knowledge base, waiting for next invocation and evolution.

This method breaks the linear "input - organize - output" process, making both parallel, mutually nourishing spirals. Its greatest benefit is **curing "blank page fear"**—you never start from zero; each creation iterates and realizes existing thinking. Of course, it requires your knowledge base itself to be "alive," filled with your own links and thinking, not an information graveyard. This also makes me reflect that perhaps the best creative tool is a system allowing convenient "left foot stepping on right foot."

Have you had similar "self-propelling" experiences? What are your "left foot" and "right foot" respectively? Welcome to share in comments below or via letter.

## Discovered Good Stuff

### Tencent Hunyuan Motion

![GitHub Introduction](../_images/12%20玄光周刊-「左脚踩右脚」的创作方法-1769840627504.webp)

An open-source 3D motion generation large model launched by Tencent Hunyuan at year-end, currently mainly used for text-to-3D-character-motion direction. Most surprising is it's open-source—meaning animators or small game development teams can use it to quickly build storyboards, prototypes, theoretically saving significant production costs.

Of course, such models require higher hardware foundation compared to relatively simple Chat models. Motion effects demonstrated on the website introduction are quite good—should integrate well into existing workflows. Will try deploying one to test.

### Submitted a Bug to Centileo Renderer

Using version 0.717 with C4D 2025, graphics card 5070ti. Encountered an issue with specific material settings causing rendering artifacts. Reported through their official channels—appreciate developers who maintain open communication with users.

## Creative Workflow Evolution

Reflecting on this "left foot stepping on right foot" method reveals how creative workflows evolve:

- **From linear to cyclical**: Traditional workflows follow straight paths; this method creates feedback loops
- **From separation to integration**: Knowledge management and creation become intertwined
- **From scarcity to abundance**: Each piece of work generates material for future work
- **From pressure to flow**: The process becomes more natural and less forced

What methods have you developed to make your creative process more sustainable and generative? How do you ensure your work feeds back into your growth rather than depleting your resources?
