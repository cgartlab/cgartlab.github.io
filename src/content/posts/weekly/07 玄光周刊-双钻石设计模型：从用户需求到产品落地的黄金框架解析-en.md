title: 07 Xuan Guang Weekly - Double Diamond Design Model: Golden Framework Analysis from User Needs to Product Implementation
published: 2025-07-25
description: Want to understand how the double diamond design model connects "user needs" with "product implementation"? This article deeply analyzes its four stages (discover-define-develop-deliver) core tasks and output results, revealing how the "golden framework" achieves complete workflow from concept to product through iterative design. Whether you're a product manager, designer, or brand strategist, you can gain systematic design methodology to improve project implementation efficiency.

This week's cover was shot in a small alley near Badaguan University Road in Qingdao—a very beautiful cafe storefront. Apparently, most buildings in this area were constructed by Germans during the Qing dynasty. Further down this alley is Lao She's former residence. If you have the chance, you should come experience sitting by the sea drinking coffee, listening to music, and enjoying the sea breeze.

Additionally, while editing each issue's content, I'm also fine-tuning the text ordering (in my view, the reading experience of textual content itself takes precedence over visual experience), exploring and feeling relatively better reading experience formats. If you have better optimization suggestions, welcome to provide feedback privately.

## Worthwhile New Updates

### PNG 3 Update

The PNG format is something almost every designer, illustrator, and artist frequently encounters. Last month, they released the latest PNG 3 specification. PNG (**Portable Network Graphics**) is a widely used **lossless compression** bitmap image format designed specifically to replace the earlier GIF format. That's right—initially, GIF was also a widely used static image format, but due to its animation support feature, it eventually became synonymous with animated images and emojis.

For designers, PNG 3 might require attention to the following new features:

- **Official APNG Animation Support (Replacing GIF)**
  Higher quality animated images: APNG supports 24-bit true color (16 million colors) and 8-bit alpha transparency channels, compared to GIF's 256 colors and 1-bit transparency, enabling smoother gradients and anti-aliasing effects.
  Smaller file sizes: APNG uses intelligent frame difference compression, storing only changed parts, saving more space than GIF.
  Improved compatibility: Previously APNG was only supported by some browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari), now becoming an official standard, expected to have broader software support in the future.
  Design applications: Suitable for high-quality animated logos, UI interactive effects, emojis, etc., can replace GIF.

- **Native HDR Support (High Dynamic Range)**
  Wider color gamut & higher brightness: PNG 3 supports HDR colors through CICP (only 16 bytes), suitable for professional photography, gaming, film and television scenes requiring high-fidelity colors.

- **Native Exif Metadata Support**
  Better copyright management: Can embed shooting parameters, copyright information, GPS, etc., facilitating image tracing and management.
  Optimized storage format: Compared to older unofficial Exif embedding, the new version is more efficient, reducing redundant data.

- **Lighter Color Space Description (CICP)**
  Reduced file size: Compared to traditional ICC color profiles (300+ bytes), CICP requires only 16 bytes, suitable for large quantities of small-sized images (like web icons).

## Double Diamond Design Model Framework

![Double Diamond Design Process Visualization](../_images/07%20玄光周刊-双钻石设计模型：从用户需求到产品落地的黄金框架解析-1754597085815.webp)

The double diamond model represents a structured approach to design thinking, dividing the process into four distinct phases:

- **First Diamond: Problem Space**

- **Discover**: Research and understand user needs through observation and empathy
- **Define**: Synthesize findings to define the core problem statement

- **Second Diamond: Solution Space**

- **Develop**: Generate and explore multiple potential solutions
- **Deliver**: Test, refine, and implement the best solution

## Practical Application Insights

Having worked with this framework across various projects, I've found several key benefits:

- **Structured Creativity**: Provides clear milestones while allowing creative exploration
- **User-Centered Focus**: Ensures solutions address real user needs rather than assumptions
- **Iterative Improvement**: Encourages continuous refinement based on feedback
- **Team Alignment**: Creates common language and process across multidisciplinary teams

What design frameworks have you found most effective in your work? How do you balance structured processes with creative flexibility?
