This week's cover was shot at Qingdao St. Michael's Cathedral. Rarely having leisure time to gather friends for an outing. Domestic tourism style emphasizes "since we're here anyway"—must visit a few landmarks. This Catholic cathedral wasn't as large as imagined, but seeing a full-scale pipe organ for the first time was quite impressive. Strangely, no nuns or priests were seen—perhaps they're on vacation during peak tourist season?

I don't follow any religion, only interested in their perspectives on viewing and deconstructing the world. For example, not believing in Buddhism but enjoying contemplating Buddhist teachings, even borrowing some of their thinking to incorporate into artistic creation. After all, humans can never avoid those ultimate questions.

## Astro Framework

This is an emerging frontend framework from recent years, already rapidly updated to version 5.x.

This week's issue was delayed because last week I rebuilt the blog with Astro architecture, spending a whole week on it. The architecture itself isn't complex—more time-consuming was converting old site article data into markdown format text. Plus various assets like images made it more troublesome. Fortunately, the new architecture is faster with more flexible configuration. The only remaining small issue is RSS links changing from `https://cgartlab.com/feed` to `https://cgartlab.com/rss.xml`—can only temporarily use Cloudflare page rules for link forwarding, a roundabout solution at best. Very satisfied with other aspects of this upgrade.

## OpenCut

An open-source video editing software competing with CapCut. Since the international version of CapCut also started membership systems, I had a预感 an open-source alternative would appear—finally here, and sponsored by the famous Vercel! Early alpha public testing has begun, interested friends can try it.

## MAKING SOFTWARE

A very exquisite website, described by the author as a reference manual written for software designers and builders.

## Ambient Sounds

A white noise website I've been loving recently, with open-source code. Can freely combine over 80 different ambient sounds, adjust volumes, save as presets. Easily create your preferred atmosphere, and share preset sound combinations via links. Also, relatively simple site structure makes it great as a practice open-source project.

## Architectural Reflections

Visiting historical architecture like St. Michael's Cathedral always makes me reflect on design principles that stand the test of time:

- **Proportion and scale**: How buildings relate to human dimensions
- **Material authenticity**: Using materials honestly rather than imitating others
- **Functional beauty**: When practical requirements create aesthetic value
- **Cultural context**: How design reflects and shapes its time and place

These principles apply equally to digital design. Just as cathedrals were built to inspire and serve communities, good software should enhance human capabilities and experiences.

What historical or architectural inspirations have influenced your creative work? How do timeless design principles inform your modern practice?
