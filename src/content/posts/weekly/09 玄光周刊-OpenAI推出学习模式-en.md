This week's cover features a monstera plant I keep at home. Initially placed in the living room, it wasn't thriving well. After moving it to the study, it regained vitality, growing from 7 leaves to 12. The color of newly emerged leaves is extremely vibrant, almost artificial-looking. It sits on a small refrigerator in the corner by the window—every two weeks or so, the leaves quietly stretch toward the light, requiring occasional pot rotation.

## OpenAI Launches Learning Mode

On July 29, 2025, OpenAI launched ChatGPT Learning Mode, aiming to solve educational challenges: how to make AI truly assist learning rather than just providing answers.

Data shows the proportion of American teenagers using ChatGPT for homework has increased from 13% to 26%, but over-reliance on AI may lead to students lacking independent thinking. Thus, Learning Mode was born, with the goal of helping students achieve effective learning by guiding understanding of knowledge rather than copying answers.

Interestingly, notebooklm mentioned in [this weekly issue](https://cgartlab.com/05-the-art-of-dreammaking-behind-the-scenes-of-film-production-and-the-innovation-of-ai-tools/) also introduced a feature generating teaching videos from notes. The generated video content consists of audio explanations and automatically playing slides. I estimate domestic tech giants will quickly follow in this field, and soon AI will begin impacting the education and training industry.

In my view, this is good news. The domestic education and training industry will still exist, and quality could improve significantly.

## Why Use Newsletter Format for Content Dissemination?

This is one of the earliest newsletters I subscribed to called "News Lab." On its introduction page, the author briefly listed several reasons for using newsletter format for content dissemination:

> - On social media platforms, your data and your audience's data belong to the platform; in newsletters, your data belongs to you.
>
> - On social media platforms, whether you have 100 followers or 1 million, you can't "take them away"—you can only interact with them on that platform; in newsletters, you own your audience's email addresses, which you can export from one newsletter tool and use in another.
>
> - Social media platform algorithms determine how far your content spreads, and most platform algorithms favor eye-catching, emotionally stimulating content—serious, in-depth content struggles to surface; in newsletters, you don't need clickbait or sensational formats—the only thing you need to do is write quality content so your audience won't unsubscribe.
>
> - For audiences, consuming content on social media is a state of being "fed" by algorithms—a passive, aimless "scrolling"; reading newsletters is completely active choice, establishing direct relationships with authors.

Email isn't popular domestically, and I learned about newsletter as a creative format relatively late. Admittedly, email now seems like a rather ancient dissemination channel. Newsletters can be seen as the most primitive "public accounts," with cross-platform capability being their biggest feature.

Ironically, public account content doesn't always reach the public. Email only requires an email address—no real-name verification, no IP exposure, not even a real email address needed—authors can establish one-on-one relationships with readers. Each subscription to an author gives readers additional "eyes" to better capture other interesting things in the world.

As the original article mentioned, newsletter is a "de-platformed" dissemination method. Both authors and readers are "users" in platforms' eyes—soil for platform revenue generation. This注定 information dissemination under platforms always pursues quantity, speed, quality, and efficiency—more traffic, faster trend-chasing, better mass emotion targeting, easier content production.

## IGLOO Creative Website Design

IGLOO is a creative agency with an exceptionally well-designed website. What's particularly impressive is their use of interactive elements and micro-animations that enhance user experience without being distracting.

The site demonstrates how thoughtful design can make technical information accessible and engaging. For anyone interested in web design or digital storytelling, it's worth exploring for inspiration.

## Content Creation Philosophy

Reflecting on newsletter format versus social media platforms raises interesting questions about content creation:

- **Ownership vs. reach**: Do you prioritize controlling your platform or maximizing audience size?
- **Quality vs. virality**: Should content aim for depth or shareability?
- **Direct relationships vs. algorithmic distribution**: What's more valuable—knowing your readers personally or reaching more people?

These aren't either/or choices, but understanding the trade-offs helps make intentional decisions about how and where to share creative work.

What dissemination formats have you found most effective for your content? How do you balance platform benefits with creative control?
