This week's cover sponsored by the boss.

Speaking of which, as the weather gets colder, 👆 this one eats more (and poops more too). Has grown from 2.25kg when first brought home last year to over 3.5kg now—definitely feels heavier when picked up. It's been a year and a half since bringing her home. Even if she becomes a "gas tank," it's fine as long as she's safe and healthy.

Whether writing or drawing, creative people seem to like keeping cats. I previously wrote [thoughts about pets](https://cgartlab.com/posts/cat-dog-confidence/)—interested readers can check it out.

## [Google Design - Discover the people and stories behind the products](https://design.google/?home=)

I spent almost the entire last year dealing with UI/UX fields, saw many companies showcasing their unique UI design philosophy introductions. After circling around, it still comes back to Google 👍.

Google Design website is Google's official platform showcasing its design philosophy, team stories, and thinking behind products. It's not just a portfolio but a window deeply exploring "how design shapes technology, and how technology serves people" [1].

Website content covers evolution from Material Design language to in-depth analysis of interaction details for specific products like Google Search, Maps, Assistant, etc. For designers and developers, this provides rare opportunities to understand how global top tech companies transform complex algorithms and massive data into accessible, intuitive experiences for ordinary people.

Content forms are very rich, including long-form design case studies, designer interviews, and thoughtful articles about design ethics and future trends. For example, you might read about challenges designing inclusive experiences for billions of global users, or how Google Fonts team develops and refines font systems supporting hundreds of languages. This content not only shows final design outcomes but reveals trade-offs behind decisions, failures and learning during iteration processes, and cross-functional team collaboration details.

## [The Motion Awards 2025](https://motionawards.com/)

If involving dynamic visuals, animation effects in UX fields still seem limited by inherent thinking constraints from my perspective. Looking across the entire dynamic visual field, I once gained infinite inspiration from The Motion Awards—striving to win this award once in my career. Dreams should exist.

The Motion Awards is an annual award focusing on recognizing outstanding achievements in global motion design field. It covers motion graphics, brand animation, film title design, UI animation, advertising shorts, and other categories—an important stage for motion designers and studios to showcase strength and gain industry recognition. Participating works often represent the highest standards in creativity, technical execution, and narrative expression for that year's motion design. Browsing award-winning works is like watching a condensed annual design trend show, clearly seeing how new technologies (like real-time rendering, AI generation), new styles, and new narrative techniques are used by pioneering creators.

For practitioners or students, this heavyweight award's official website is a valuable learning resource inspiration library.

You can systematically see how excellent motion design effectively conveys information and inspires emotions across different media and needs, from abstract visual experiments to commercial brand promotion. Many award-winning works include creator team interviews or production analyses, revealing complete processes from concept sketches to final films—involved software techniques, collaboration methods, and creative thinking are very inspiring.

## [Good design | About us | Vitsœ](https://www.vitsoe.com/eu/about/good-design)

Vitsœ's philosophy about good design resonates deeply with my own approach to creative work. Their emphasis on longevity, adaptability, and thoughtful craftsmanship aligns with principles that transcend specific design disciplines.

What I appreciate most is their commitment to designing products that last—both physically and aesthetically. In an era of disposable technology and fleeting trends, this approach feels particularly relevant for digital design as well.

## Design Philosophy Integration

Reflecting on these different design perspectives helps me integrate various principles into my own work:

- **Google's systematic approach**: Creating scalable, consistent experiences
- **Motion design's emotional impact**: Using movement to enhance storytelling
- **Vitsœ's timeless quality**: Designing for longevity and adaptability
- **Personal authenticity**: Staying true to individual creative vision

How do you integrate different design philosophies into your work? What principles have stood the test of time in your creative practice?
