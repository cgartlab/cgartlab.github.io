This week's cover was taken during my study abroad in Thailand. What does it have to do with early rising? Perhaps for me, both represent ways to establish order in life.

## Free Benefits

After quitting my job to start my own business, it took me almost a year to gradually develop the habit of early to bed and early to rise. Although I still have to pull all-nighters for important urgent projects—this is unavoidable as a designer, especially in the CG field—I do allow myself to sleep in for a few days after intense work periods.

Recently, I was chatting with friends about early sleep schedules, and they were curious why I still "push myself" when I don't have a regular job. By the way, my current weekday routine is waking up at 5:30 AM, resting after 6-7 PM, and sleeping around 9:30 or 10 PM. To my friends, this schedule makes me seem like an early retiree.

My response is: this brings free benefits.

First, as a designer, working late nights is unavoidable. The long-term health risks are well-known, but there's also a difficult short-term issue: as we age, we need longer recovery time after staying up late.

I've noticed this very clearly in myself. For example, during university, I could pull all-nighters doing assignments and feel fine the next day. Now, I need almost twelve hours of sleep to barely shake off the fatigue and find it hard to concentrate. This means future work efficiency will only decline.

So I thought, since staying up late is unavoidable, and I need those hours of sleep anyway, the optimal solution is to switch to "morning shifts"—simply advance the entire biological clock. Morning is when thinking is most active, suitable for focused problem-solving, and few working clients contact you for deliveries early in the morning, meaning fewer interruptions. By the time the day's tasks are done, it's probably not even dark yet, leaving more opportunity to handle other chores like getting a haircout or picking up packages.

Actually, rather than calling it "free benefits," a more accurate description would be "reclaiming time that was always yours."

People usually think waking up early is easy, but sticking to it daily is harder. In my view, the most challenging part is being able to switch flexibly between sleeping in and early rising. Sticking to one thing until it becomes a habit is relatively easy. But how do you make switching between two or more habits itself a habit? This requires discipline and resilience.

## Dropbox Brand Visual Update

The last time I used Dropbox was during university, storing top 100 Douban e-books that are still there. I stopped using it mainly because of internet accessibility issues. If it weren't blocked, among domestic cloud storage options, I'd hardly consider any besides OneDrive and Dropbox.

It's quite rare for a company focused on cloud storage services to still pay such attention to design.
