The first cover naturally comes from Luya—this was taken about a month after she arrived at my home, when she had just gotten familiar with the environment and dared to jump on the desk to supervise my work.

## The Magic Numbers on the Clock

Recently, I made a pact with friends to motivate each other to stick to early rising. On a weekend morning, we stumbled upon an interesting phenomenon.

Around 7-8 AM, it feels quite early, but once it passes 10 AM, it feels almost like noon. The gap is only two hours! However, at 7 PM it doesn't feel like evening at all—only midnight truly qualifies as evening, with a five-hour difference in between!

I searched online and indeed found an explanation.

> **Time perception refers to the awareness of the continuity and sequence of objective phenomena.** It relates to activity content, emotions, motivations, attitudes, as well as the physical properties of stimuli and context. Additionally, people tend to underestimate longer time intervals while overestimating shorter ones. The simpler the stimulus encoding, the shorter the perceived duration. Different senses vary in accurately judging time intervals, with hearing and touch being most accurate.

Zooming out to a larger scale, we often sigh: "Clouds drifted so slowly in childhood, but as adults, a year passes in the blink of an eye." The common explanation online is that one year in childhood represents a fraction of life lived, while in adulthood it's only a tiny fraction, creating the illusion of time accelerating.

I agree with this.

But I also recall something my middle school physics teacher told us during class. As we approached the high school entrance exams, his message was essentially: "There's still a month until the exams, but don't panic. A month is 30 days—don't let the situation 30 days from now scare you today. You can accomplish a tremendous amount in 30 days."

The insight this gives me is that although humans are irrational creatures, at critical moments—like making important decisions or facing life-changing junctures—we shouldn't be deceived by sensory illusions. If something doesn't make logical sense, then consider whether it's worth gambling on intuition.
