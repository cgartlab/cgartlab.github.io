## Introduction

[Previous Part](https://cgartlab.com/posts/rss-1/) mainly introduced the basic uses of RSS and the significance of deep reading in the fragmented era. As an important component of the information collection stage mentioned in [Analyzing the Designer's Second Brain: From Concept to Practice](https://cgartlab.com/posts/second-brain-for-designer), this part shares how I gradually built my own fragmented information collection system based on RSS. At the end, I'll recommend some quality RSS sources and tools I subscribe to, listed in no particular order. In fact, tools are the least important aspect—as long as they're convenient, even email can work. This article assumes readers have some understanding of RSS and have used RSS subscription tools.

## Information Collection System

Anything labeled as a "system" often gives the impression of being complicated and having a high learning curve. Actually, in my view, what matters more is "information." The initial motivation for everything is "finding information useful to oneself." Asking the right question solves half the problem. Doing the right thing is far more important than doing things right. The system is essentially an information processing factory that classifies, filters, eliminates, and beautifies information, then packages this entire process into a "box."

## Clarifying Your Needs

Clarifying needs might be a professional habit (or habit) as a designer. During the early stages of negotiating [numerous commercial projects](https://cgartlab.com/works/), about 80% of the time is spent helping myself (and clients) understand their real needs. In fact, the prevalence of recommendation algorithms today also proves that most people don't understand their real needs, or to put it more bluntly, are too lazy to understand.

So how to quickly and accurately determine what kind of information you actually need? The method I use is also the most common in design thinking: write it down, sketch it out. Thinking in your head and putting it on paper are completely different concepts, somewhat similar to passively receiving pushes versus actively thinking and searching for information.

### Finding Your Areas of Interest

Recommendation algorithms guess what type of content users like based on their interests, attempting to solve our information needs. Let's reverse this perspective: our needs are largely determined by interests, at least on the surface.

Take a moment to summarize your areas of interest and topics. They don't need to be precise descriptions—any keywords will do. Write as many as you can, whether broad or specific, preferably making a list. For example, what I initially wrote was:

Art, meditation, cats, technology, painting, products, design, unofficial history, science fiction, animation, cyberpunk, knowledge management, retro trends, electronics, writing, fountain pens, mechanical keyboards, DIY-NAS, programming, psychology...

### Classifying by Format or Timeliness

I believe you'll write down no fewer than I did. Then, based on these interest areas, think about what type of information you usually consume. For example, digital technology might be news reports or new product launches; digital art might be industry trends or directly an artist's Instagram page; visual design might be category rankings on a website or a illustrator's Weibo account; front-end development might be an official website or an industry expert's independent blog, etc.

These interest keywords are like tags. Typically, each subscription source comes with at least one link. My personal organization method mainly classifies by content format, currently still relatively rough:

- IT (Technology & Digital)
- News (Finance, various morning briefings)
- Blog (Independent blogs, miscellaneous content, relatively chaotic)
- Design (Large design studio websites, designer personal websites, social media, etc.)

This is my personal classification method. Actually, everyone's identity itself carries a clear goal: learning, work, hobbies, entertainment, or research, etc. You can also divide these interest areas according to your purpose. By writing this far, I believe you already have some idea about your answer.

Previously when working in an office, a colleague classified information by timeliness. For example, he liked investing and would naturally read the latest market reports, while knowledge management didn't require such urgency—at most checking new features of a tool every few months. Some tools' current features already completely met his needs, so he stayed with the most comfortable version, putting more energy into personal development and outputting quality content.

One point to note is distinguishing between interests and goals. Interests are natural drivers for actively acquiring information, while goals compared to interests need to be more specific and practical, involving highly customized workflows that require personal exploration.

Classifying by format is more suitable for handling multiple weakly related interest areas. If your listed interest areas are few and strongly related—for example, your macro-level interests only involve your work scope—then classifying by timeliness might be more appropriate.

Taking myself as an example again: my profession is 3D designer, and its parent field is obviously design. Then classifying design field information by timeliness could be divided into the following categories, with viewing frequency increasing progressively:

- Daily/Real-time
  - Industry cutting-edge technology news
  - Software update logs
  - Technical forum hot posts
- Weekly/Monthly
  - Plugin/script updates
  - Workflow optimization cases
  - Video tutorials
  - Excellent author interviews
- Quarterly/Yearly
  - Asset and material updates
  - Major competition winning works
  - Excellent photography/painting/graphic/motion graphics artists' social media
  - Classic case studies
  - Master-level works

This way, over time, you'll naturally develop positive habits that help maintain an open and optimistic mindset. Whether in the workplace or running a creative team, you'll maintain certain competitiveness and won't be easily eliminated by the market. Of course, these classifications are completely flexible—no need to deliberately follow them. They'll naturally adjust according to your needs, and what I've listed are results after years of fine-tuning.

## Finding Quality Content Sources

After confirming your areas of interest, the next step is how to find quality information within those fields. Usually we're accustomed to passive pushes from major platforms, but the essence of RSS is "actively filtering information." Judging whether a subscription source is quality, in my view, should meet at least three conditions:

1. Professionalism: Vertically related to goals and interests
2. Consistent output: Stable update frequency
3. Detailed content, clear structure, with author's unique insights

Next is how to find such subscription sources quickly and accurately. My method is very straightforward:

### Method 1: Find Professional and Reliable People

When a field reaches sufficient professional depth, it's usually relatively niche. This scenario is like following a guide to find a very authentic restaurant but not finding it—what you should do is find the nearest restaurant and ask their staff, i.e., "directly consult field experts."

On the internet, for example in academic fields, you can track renowned scholars' blogs; in technical fields, find personal websites of open-source project maintainers or industry conference speakers; in art and design fields, follow case showcases on major software tool websites, where it's also easy to find creators of these artworks.

Earlier this year, I learned about a new [GPU renderer](https://weekly.cgartlab.com/p/04-repair-gpu-and-new-renderer). Since this renderer was still in early development stages, many technical processes weren't aligned with industry standards. However, I discovered on their website that their team highly valued user feedback—the main creator directly opened a discussion group on Telegram with no barriers. So I joined the group and directly asked him about when unfinished features might be released, getting a reply within about ten minutes. This is the most direct and effective method I've used. At first glance, this method seems unrelated to RSS, but think about it—behind every subscription source are ultimately living people, aren't they?

### Method 2: Keyword Expansion

This means extracting keywords from the field vocabulary in the previous steps, usually terminology. For example, learning to build a blog, keywords roughly include: domain name, server, DNS, WordPress, theme, etc.

However, real situations often aren't that smooth.

For example, a scenario I frequently encounter: I'm interested in an unfamiliar field but don't know its subdivisions. In such cases, I usually use AI to outline a rough learning framework, then extract the workflow I need through this framework, thus obtaining a bunch of keywords. Using these keywords to search for corresponding information naturally becomes more precise.

Taking blog building as an example again: servers can be subdivided into cloud hosting and self-built servers. Then I learn that WordPress is just one of the mainstream website frameworks, with blogs divided into static and dynamic blogs. The essence of web pages is documents written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Self-built blogs require setting up IPv6 penetration, which requires dynamic domain resolution and certificate deployment before penetration. The entire process completely grows out according to needs at each stage.

Notably, these two methods coincide with the architect and archaeologist thinking patterns mentioned in building the designer's second brain. Gradually you'll discover that the field you're interested in isn't as complex and profound as imagined. Starting from your core needs, the entire framework will magically form a closed loop at some point.

## Information Filtering Mechanism

I realized the need for information filtering because of Zhihu.

There was a period when I was interested in screenwriting and found professional script information usually appeared on Zhihu. But after following several professional screenwriters, Zhihu started recommending things like "How to write a story starting with xxx." Answers under such questions were usually promotions for short story writing activities, having little actual connection with script writing. I directly added "beginning, write a story" to keyword blocking.

Only then did I notice that many RSS tools specifically implement keyword filtering and trigger mechanisms. This further improves the precision of information collection, saving significant time.

This method mainly relies on software functions. Going further requires relying on your own speed reading skills for filtering. It's worth noting that I don't recommend using any AI tools for summarization, because speed reading is a very useful skill—benefiting for life with the ability to read ten lines at a glance. Also, when filtering information, don't worry about missing valuable content. Be decisive in blocking—as long as you're proactive, good content will always find you.

Of course, over time, don't forget to clean up outdated or no-longer-maintained subscription sources.

Everything discussed above are "mental techniques." The next part will detail specific "technical methods"—information collection toolchain integration solutions.
